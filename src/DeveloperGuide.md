# tLaundry Project - Developer Guide

## Current Status

The application is fully functional, and has been tested using the new tlaundry3 database.

The web application currently only supports the machines on Tembusu College Level 9. Once the functionality of the system has been verified, we plan to extend the application to cover the machines on Tembusu College Level 17 as well.

As the application was written a few years ago, there are aspects of the source code that needs to be updated according to the newest guidelines and practices for NodeJS and React.
