# tLaundry Project (formerly Tembusu Washing Machine Project)

The tLaundry project was started by Tembusians, for Tembusians.

The project aims to conceptualise and modularise a detection system for the running state of all washing machines and dryers in Tembusu College. The information collected through the detection system can then be passed to users through a Telegram bot or a mobile website.

## "tembulaundryapp"

This project is the mobile website component of the tLaundry project. It gets the data collected by the detection system and displays the results to users in a user-friendly mobile website.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Project Status

The web application currently only supports the machines on Tembusu College Level 9. Once the functionality of the system has been verified, we plan to extend the application to cover the machines on Tembusu College Level 17 as well.

## Installation & Development

In order to run the website locally, or make edits to the codebase:

1. Clone this repository to your local drive.
2. Install npm.
3. `npm start` will run the app. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), depending on your system, in order to view it in your browser.

## Credits

This project is currently being worked on under the Tembusu Student Developer Club (SDC).
